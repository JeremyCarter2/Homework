    "- NumPy arrays are similiar to Python Lists, but not the same. Lists can store multiple data types while NumPy arrays can store only one data type. \n",

    "- One of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays instead of lists is they occupy less memory. \n",

    "##### Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?\n",
