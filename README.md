I chose this image because I've always been fascinated by analyzing and visualizing data. At work, or in my personal life, I have always looked for insights and meaning in data. I am passionate about learning and growing and I believe that learning by exploring something I love, fantasy football and sports, will allow me to stay motivated and grow my skills.
